Like most challenges, this one can be made easier by "chunking" it into more manageable pieces. For example:


    1. Writing the general outline of the function for the component: 
   
        function ComponentName() {
                
        }
     
    2. Writing the return statement for the function: 
    
        function ComponentName() {
            return [insert what you want to return here]
        }        
            
    3. Setting up the props: 
    
        function ComponentName(props) {
            return [insert what you want to return here with props now inserted]
        }
                  
    4. Passing in the props: 
    
        <ComponentName 
            someProp={something}
            anotherProp={somethingElse}
        />
